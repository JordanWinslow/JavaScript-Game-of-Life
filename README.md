  <h1>The "Game of Life" in JavaScript & React</h1>
</a>

<p>
  This project utilizes React.js and state management to reproduce the famous "Game of Life" simulation 
</p>
<p>
  The code within demonstrates knowledge of the following foundations of JavaScript:
<strong>
<ul>
  <li>Event Handlers (4 direction input)
  <li>Selectors
  <li>Passing objects and functions as arguments
  <li>Object and Array destructuring
  <li>Constructors & ".this"
  <li>Loops
</ul>
</strong>

<h3>About:</h3>
              
<p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a></strong> in 1970.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

                    Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.<br />
                    Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.<br />
                    Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.<br />

                    Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.<br />
